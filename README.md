# TOP Intermediate HTML/CSS Course Project - Admin Dashboard
02/07/2022 ~ 02/08/2022

## Objectives

Using HTML and CSS, recreate the admin dashboard design provided.

Use flexbox and grid where needed, relying mostly on grid for layout purposes.

Site does not have to be responsive.

Colours and content of the dashboard can be customized.

## Learnings

Pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to layout 1D things with grid (such as for the icons in the sidebar nav.)

Previously I only used grid once for my TOP JS basics calculator project and have mostly been relying on flexbox for all my other projects. Going forward I will think more about reaching for grid.
